# CancerType-Clustering

## Hierarchical Clustering of Cancer Types Based on Inmunohistochemisty Staining Levels
Staining profiles for proteins in human tumor tissue based on immunohistochemisty using tissue micro arrays and log-rank P value for Kaplan-Meier analysis of correlation between mRNA expression level and patient survival. The tab-separated file includes Ensembl gene identifier ("Gene"), gene name ("Gene name"), tumor name ("Cancer"), the number of patients annotated for different staining levels ("High", "Medium", "Low" & "Not detected") and log-rank p values for patient survival and mRNA correlation ("prognostic - favorable", "unprognostic - favorable", "prognostic - unfavorable", "unprognostic - unfavorable").

The data is based on The Human Protein Atlas version 22.0 and Ensembl version 103.38.

## Introduction
The aim of this project is to perform a hierarchical clustering analysis on different types of cancer based on protein staining. Protein staining provides valuable insights into the presence and expression of specific proteins, which can be indicative of cancer development and progression. By clustering the cancer types according to the staining patterns, we can identify potential similarities or differences in gene expression profiles among the various cancer types.

To achieve this, we will utilize a hierarchical clustering approach.
